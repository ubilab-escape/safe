Safe Activation:

- Put the switches in the correct Position and divide the Input Voltage to the correct value for powering the safe

- Try to put the resistors in series and parallel to divide the voltage

- Resistors in parallel decrease the resistance while resistors in series increase the overall resistance

- Try to use two one kilo ohm resistors and one two kilo ohm resistor


Safe:

- Somewhere in this room must be a hint for remembering the safe code
